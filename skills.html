            I greatly improved my Python skills during my MSc in computer
            science, completing modules such as Python Programming, Python OOP,
            and Machine Learning with Python. I created a text-based fighting

            As part of my Master's project I created a web scraper to scrape 6
            years of historical weather data and wrote a route generating
            algorithm in Python that formed the basis for our 6 person project.

            As part of my work in the NTMA, I set up Python for the data
            services team and wrote the documentaion detailing its set-up and
            use. I implemented Python scripts into our ETL pipeline via TabPy in
            Tableau Prep flows. I have used Python to train machine learning
            models, implement sensitive name masking into the ETL pipeline,
            perform sentiment analysis on free-text fields, and perform
            similarity analysis on free-text fields. I also wrote scripts to
            automatically verify the totals given in solicitor bills of cost in
            PDF format, and created a PyWebIO application to act as a front end
            for these scripts.

            I first encountered R in a Data Programming with R module that I
            chose to do as part of my Master's.

          <p>I went on to use R extensively as part of my work in the NTMA.</p>

            this role I have used R to train machine learning models, manipulate

          <p>
            I was instrumental in the integration of R scripts into our ETL
            pipeline, setting up and documenting the use of Rserve to embed R
            scripts into Tableau Prep flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used R to manipulate the underlying geoJSON file for the

            Certain countries needed to have distant islands or overseas

          <p>
            I was introduced to SQL in my HDip module Relational Databases &
            Information Systems, where I was taught how to use MySql. I then
            administered a MySQL database as part of a Software Engineering
            module's project to build an application showing Dublin Bike station
            availability and predicted future availability. I completed multiple
            assignments using MySQL as part of a Big Data Programming Module.
            <br />I acted as the data lead for my MSc research practicuum team
            and administered a PostgreSQL data base to supply data to the

            As part of my role in the NTMA I write SQL queries in Oracle SQL
            Developer to extract data from an Oracle server. I wrote the SQL

            I use Linux on my personal computer and am comfortable using the

            scripts to automate tasks and solve problems as part a Big Data
            Programming module. I now use bash scripts to automate and simplify
            certain process on my personal computer. One example of this is the
            following batch script that is triggered to run every time I open my
            budget spreadsheet via a macro in the spreadsheet. It obtains the
            current price of an index fund I am interested in, which is then
            automatically inserted into a particular cell of the spreadsheet.

            In my data analyst role in the NTMA I use Tableau every day to
            create dashboards and prepare data for reports. I've created many
            dashboards that are currently in production and used by teams across
            the NTMA. One such dashboard contains an interactive map of active
            claims in Garda divisions, districts and stations across the
            country. When users select a division or district to drill down on,
            the map and other visuals are updated to show the relevant
            information.<br />
            I also make extensive use of Tableau Prep, creating flows to combine
            datasources, run data through machine learning models via embedded
            Python or R scripts, and implement processing techniques such as
            sentiment analysis and text similarity analysis. I've made a public
            Tableau workbook containing interactive and filterable maps,
            available

            I first encountered HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a Web Application
            Development Module. In this module I made two websites using just
            these technologies. I used these again as part of my Software
            Development module and Master's project, and in building this
